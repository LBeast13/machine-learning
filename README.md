<h1>Introduction</h1>
You can find in this repositery some Machine Learning Algorithm and related Topics developped in Python related with Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa avaible course on Machine Learning at https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html/

<h1>The Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA)</h1>

This is the most simple learning algorithm.

<h1>The Linear Regression Algorithm (LRA)</h1>

This is close to the PLA but much faster because this is a "one-step" learning.
