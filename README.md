<h1>Introduction</h1>
You can find in this repositery some Machine Learning Algorithm developped in Python.

<h1>The Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA)</h1>

This is the most simple learning algorithm.

<h1>The Linear Regression Algorithm (LRA)</h1>

This is close to the PLA but much faster because this is a "one-step" learning.
